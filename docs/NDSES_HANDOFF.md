# NDSES Website Handoff

For NDS Environmental Solutions staff. This sheet covers what you own, what to do once before launch, and where to go for everyday updates. Step-by-step instructions for every screen are in the [Website Guide](EDITOR_GUIDE.md).

## Your website

- **Site:** `https://ndses.flywheelsites.com`
- **Admin (where you edit):** `https://ndses.flywheelsites.com/wp-admin`
- **Built on:** WordPress, hosted on Flywheel, with the free Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin for the edit forms.
- **Changes appear on the live site within about 5 minutes** of clicking Update or Publish.

## Accounts NDSES should own

Make sure an NDSES owner (not only the developer) can sign in to each of these. Keep passwords in a password manager, never in email or this document.

- [ ] WordPress admin (at least one NDSES Administrator account)
- [ ] Flywheel hosting account
- [ ] Domain registrar and DNS (Cloudflare, if used)
- [ ] PayEngine merchant dashboard
- [ ] Google account used for reCAPTCHA, Analytics, and Search Console
- [ ] Facebook and Instagram pages

## One-time setup before launch

1. **Site Settings** (left menu → Site Settings). Check phone, email, both addresses, office hours (one line per row), footer text, Facebook and Instagram links, Mission Statement, and About Page: Our Story. The **Email** field is where every website form submission is sent.
2. **Dumpster Sizes and Commercial Containers.** The site currently shows its built-in sizes, which are already up to date. To manage them yourself, enter **all** sizes first, then publish them together. As soon as one entry is published, the site shows only published entries.
3. **Open content questions:** confirm the 2 Yard dimensions (spreadsheet and graphic disagree), send the correct 8 Yard "Ideal For" text, and send a 96 Gallon graphic if you have one.
4. **Spam protection:** add the reCAPTCHA site key and secret key in Site Settings.
5. **Payments:** keep PayEngine in test mode until the PayEngine account review is complete. Then follow "Accepting Payments" in the Website Guide to switch to live keys.
   - **Certification checklist status (Oct 22, 2026):** every row is filled in, and all 8 sandbox test payments passed on the live page: $100 and $0.20 by card and by bank, a declined card, and a failed bank payment. One item is still open: before switching to live keys, confirm in the PayEngine dashboard that the live public key only works on the NDS website's domain.
6. **Legal pages:** replace the placeholder Privacy Policy and Terms text with your reviewed versions.
7. **Test it:** submit the Contact form yourself, confirm the email arrives, and confirm it's listed under **Form Submissions**.

## Good to know

- **Built-in content.** FAQs, Service Areas, Dumpster Sizes, and Commercial Containers each show built-in content until you publish your first entry of that kind. After that, only your entries show, so enter the full set before publishing.
- **Menus you can ignore:** Services, Documents, Schedule Items, and the "Page Sections" box on pages. They aren't used by the site.
- **Secret keys** (PayEngine Secret Key, reCAPTCHA Secret Key) work like passwords. Don't share them or paste them anywhere else.
- **Calculator logic** on the Dumpster Calculator page is set in code. Ask your developer to change which size it recommends.

## When to contact your developer

New pages or layout changes, adding a new community, changing recycling or bulk-item lists, payment or PayEngine problems, error messages, or access problems.
